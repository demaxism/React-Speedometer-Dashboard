# Speed meter demo project
This project demonstrates a speedometer as a reusable component.

# Environment
Node version v12.20.0
This is a React project.

# Install
`npm install`

# Run 
`npm start`
and access localhost:3000 in browser.


# Limitation
The transition animation of the speed indicator arc is not perfectly smooth due to drawing large amount of svg arcs each frame, this could be improved by using arcTween().
